During my internship with Infobyte, I successfully completed several key projects, including a personal portfolio website, a dynamic landing page, and a thermometer application. The portfolio highlights my skills and previous work with a responsive design, while the landing page is crafted to engage users with interactive elements and clear calls-to-action. The thermometer application features a modern UI to display temperature data effectively. Each project utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure functionality and aesthetic appeal. I am excited about the experience gained and look forward to future opportunities. ðŸš€ðŸ˜Š
